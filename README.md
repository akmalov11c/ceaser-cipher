Caesar Cipher README

Introduction

This repository contains a Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithms. 
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
 - Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher.
 - Support for reading messages from the console or from a text file.
 - Ability to specify the shift value for encryption and decryption.
 - Output results to a text file for convenience.
   
Usage
 1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
    ```
 3. Navigate to the Directory: Enter the cloned directory:
    
    ```
    cd caesar-cipher
    ```
 5. Run the Program: Run the Python program by executing the following command:
    
    ```
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```
 7. Follow the Instructions: Follow the prompts to choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message, specify the shift value, and provide the message or filename accordingly.

    
File Structure
 - caesar_cipher.py: The main Python script containing the implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithms.
 - results.txt: The output file where encrypted or decrypted messages are written.

   
Example
Here's an example of how to use the program:

 1. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
 2. Specify the shift value (e.g., 3 for shifting each letter three places down the alphabet).
 3. Enter the message to encrypt or decrypt.
 4. Optionally, choose to encrypt or decrypt another message.
